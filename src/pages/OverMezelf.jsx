        <p>
          I am a dedicated young software developer ready for all kinds of
          challenges. I'm very eager to learn and experience new things. When I
          start a project I will always do everything in my power to complete
          the project. My main skills are programming related, like Java,
          Javascript, React, HTML, CSS, etc. I'm very well traveled, I've been
          to USA, Canada etc, so I have experienced different cultures around
          the world.
